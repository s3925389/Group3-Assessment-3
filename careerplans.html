    <h1>Cristopher Ariel Castro Inostroza – S3923904</h1><br>
    <p>I have chosen Cloud Computing Architect. So far is the right path for me unless, IOT (Internet of Things) gets more interesting for me soon. To make sure I understand what is behind        the scenes in Cloud Architect computing. I need to understand and get familiarised with the fallowing technologies:<br><br>
      <strong>Java, Python or C#</strong><br>
      Most architects have a software development background. An efficient AWS (Amazon Web Services) architect should be able to write code in Java, Python, C# 
        <strong>Networking </strong><br>
        It is hard to create a secure, scalable cloud-based solution without understanding networking. DNS, TCP/IP, HTTP, CDN and VPN are only a few of the terms you want to make yourself familiar with.<br><br>
        <strong> Data storage fundamentals</strong><br>
        Every software architect needs to know and understand how and when to use databases. In AWS, where you have many data storage options available, you need to be able to know when to use each.<br><br>
        <strong>Security foundations</strong><br>
        From securing access to your AWS account to securing access to your data, AWS has several services and guidelines created specifically to help you make sure only authorized code and people are allowed to perform specific tasks.<br><br>
        <strong>Cloud-specific patterns and technologies</strong><br>
        Once you move code into the cloud some rules change. Scalability, availability, and recovery become easy—if you design your workloads and harness AWS infrastructure correctly.<br><br>
        <strong>Communication</strong><br>
        Designing great architecture does not mean a thing if you fail to explain your vision to software developers, managers, and fellow architects. You will need to learn to explain your ideas via emails, documents and presentations in a way that convinces your team why your solution is the best.<br><br>
        <strong>Rock AWS Cloud architecture </strong><br>
        The skills essential to this role may sound like a lot, but they amount to a role that is more crucial to organizations than ever. Whether you start by learning about a few AWS services, preparing for the AWS solution architect certification test, or choosing a specific focus area (i.e., security, big data, docker or serverless), there’s value in taking inventory of the collection of your skills and taking advantage of learning opportunities designed to get you to the next level.<br><br>

      <h1>Steven Pigatto – S3851506</h1>
      <p>The career plan I have chosen, Cybersecurity, is still the path I want to take down. Currently, I do not have the required skills to take on this career, not just yet. Researching the required skills to obtain a career in cybersecurity has given me a great in site of the industry and levels of experience required.<br>The skills required to gain the basic knowledge to start a career, I would require learning the following:<br>
          <ul style="padding-left:45px;">
              <li>Knowledge of networking.</li> 
               <li>Systems such as Windows and Linux.</li>

              <li>Ethical hacking and Penetration.</li>
              <li>Programming and Scripting.</li>
        </ul><br>
      <p>The path to gain these skills would be complete a relevant course that will cover these subjects. Completing a Diploma, a graduate or a Bootcamps which would cover everything and gain the hands-on skills to have an advantage of landing an entry level job. Doing research on subjects to gain ethical knowledge of cybersecurity issues to learn what the environment is like and current issues in the world.</p><br>

        <h1>Nicole Attard - S3924819</h1>
        <p>The area that I am aiming to enter into within the IT industry is in software quality assurance, with my ideal job being a software quality assurance engineer/analyst. According to Indeed.com, an experienced quality assurance engineer in Australia attracts a base income of approximately $102,000 a year (based on 117 salaries) and there are, as of November 2021, approximately 700 jobs listed for this role, or similar (Indeed, 2021).<br>Quality assurance (QA) is an essential part of the software development life cycle and throughout the years has shifted in its focus to not only ensuring that the product being developed performs as expected, but also that the product conforms with customer expectations (Maxim, Kessentini 2016).<br><br>
            For a software quality assurance engineer the most common skills appear to be:   
        <ul style="padding-left:45px;">
            <li>Bachelor's degree in software engineering, computer science, information technology or related</li>
            <li>Previous experience of at least 2 years working in the relevant field of QA </li>
            <li>Experience in API testing and automation </li>
            <li>Experience in Confluence/JIRA </li>
            <li>Knowledge of the Agile software development cycle  </li>
            <li>Knowledge of various programming languages such as Python, C, C++, Java </li>
            <li>Time management skills </li>
            <li>Organisational skills </li>
            <li>Ability to work in a team </li>
        </ul> 
        
        </p>
        <p>The tasks a software quality assurance engineer performs can include:
            <ul style="padding-left: 45px;">
                <li>Develop standards and ensure product conforms with intended purpose and customer expectations  </li>
                <li>Design systems and testing methods to check for issues </li>
                <li>Create test plans </li>
                <li>Find errors and bugs in the software </li>
                <li>Analyse and fix errors and bugs </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>To get a start in this career, I believe completing a Bachelor of IT would be a good starting point. Even though many companies appear to focus more on the experience in the industry an individual has rather than a formal qualification, considering I currently have no experience in the IT industry, I believe a bachelor's degree would provide a solid foundation upon which to build on. The flexibility of completing an RMIT bachelor's degree through Open Universities Australia will hopefully mean that I would be able to supplement the bachelor's degree with more focused studies from other sources such as short courses from Skill Finder, Udemy, edX, et cetera.<br>
        Given that I have basically no experience in the IT industry, hopefully having begun a bachelor's degree, I would be lucky enough to find any type of general junior position in the IT industry in order to gain some firsthand, practical experience, and also to have the opportunity to further my skills. While gaining this experience and completing the bachelor's and further studies, I aim to transition to a position more specific in terms of the quality assurance field, such as a junior software tester in a QA team. As I gain more experience and further my skills, I hopefully will be able to work more independently and progress further to more senior testing/quality assurance positions.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>My future career plan:</strong><br>
            Begin Bachelor of IT à find a junior position in the IT industry à work through Bachelor of IT course à supplement learning with further short online courses à find a position as a tester à upgrade skills and gain further experience à transition to a more senior position in the software quality assurance field.<br><br>

<h1>Theodore Haluska - S3925389 </h1>
<p>My intended career plan is in DevOps.

<br><h1>TEAM CAREER PLANS</h1>
<p>After reflecting on the last assessment in terms of the ideal jobs that each team member would like to have one day in the future, it appears that the ideal jobs have remained consistent. Having provided an outline of the skills each job would require in conjunction with a career plan to ultimately achieve our desired positions, not only are the skills required for each job similar, but the career paths also appear to be consistent with one another. 
</p>
<p>The general career path common for all team members despite these positions being in different sectors of the IT industry appears to be:
<ul style="padding-left: 45px;">
	<li>Obtain necessary fundamental educational foundation in information technology through a variety of different sources, such as university degrees, bootcamps, certificates, diplomas,</li>
	<li>Gain experience in the IT industry</li>
	<li>Gain appropriate and/or required certifications</li>
	<li>Develop further skills through experience and obtain further qualifications</li>
	<li>Continue progressing up the ladder through a variety of different positions to ultimately achieve ideal goal.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>The most common element across these career plans appears to be the requirement for formal education in the IT industry as well as extensive experience. Also, as clearly seen in the career plans, a number of skills and required knowledge are common despite the different IT fields. For instance, the DevOps and QA career plans both require knowledge of testing procedures, the software development lifecycle and programming languages, while cloud computing architects and cybersecurity analysts require knowledge of cloud architecture and networking processes, among others. ICT support technicians would require a great amount of knowledge over a number of different IT fields in order to perform their job functions and may not necessarily have specialised knowledge in one particular field, unless their focus is on a specific area.</p>
