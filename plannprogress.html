  <h1>Plan and Progress</h1><br>

	    <p>For our first project as a group, we each brought to the table an idea in terms of viable IT products that would be able to be created to benefit society in some way. After discussions and careful analysis of each project idea, we decided as a team to invest our time working on creating a chatbot. Given the prevalence of chatbots in the online environment, from providing customer support to things like entertainment or interactive services or even organisation management services, we believe the field of chatbot developments is one that is likely to expand and provide great benefits to individuals and businesses alike. </p><br>
    <p>Another positive factor in deciding to create a chatbot was it appeared to be the most viable project considering the simplicity of the development process and the variety of open-source tools and technologies that are currently available such as Python, Rasa NLU and TensorFlow, among others that are required for the creation of a chatbot. The development process and underlying concepts are also widely documented and ample research material is available.</p><br>
    <img src="img/plannprogress.jpg" width="500px;" height="500px;" alt="plan and progress"><br>
    <p>Once we had decided on moving forward with a chatbot idea, we provided a brief outline of the ultimate goal that we were hoping to achieve once the project was complete. The original overview and plan can be found here. Following further research and analysis and external feedback of that outline, it was determined that the scope of the project was both too large and too broad considering our limited knowledge and experience in the field of chatbot development.  </p><br>
    <p>As a result, we discussed and agreed upon limiting the scope of the project to creating a simple informational chatbot that will provide information to the user only in relation to the profile of the team members and a brief introduction to the chatbot itself, but converting the conversational/jovial tone that we were hoping to achieve into a separate feature by inserting a joke function into the chatbot where a user would be able to ask the chatbot to tell them a joke. </p><br>
    <p>Considering that we based our project on team member Cristopher's idea, Cris volunteered to take charge of the development process. Given the new revised limited scope of the project, and the fact that Cris of all the team members had the greatest understanding of chatbots and the methods to create one, we believed it would be easier to delegate the main coding and development to one person with the other team members providing support in the form of further research, discussing proposed intents and functions, and preparing the written progress report with the necessary background to document the process. </p><br>
    <p>Once this was decided, we began to discuss and outline in more detail what information the chatbot would be dealing with and how. The team agreed to limit the data initially to information that would be provided on the website, namely the team member profiles, an introduction to the chatbot itself and a few jokes that the chatbot could provide if requested by a user.  </p><br>
    <p>After some research was conducted, we opted to build a chatbot from the group up rather than use one of the many publicly available and free to use chatbot framework platforms such as AlphaChat and MobileMonkey (Vainu, 2021), where pre-built templates are provided with limited functionality. Though more time consuming and labour-intensive, building a chatbot from scratch allows the client and developer to customise the chatbot and upscale in the future. It also allows for the ability to place their chatbot on a variety of different channels such as iOS or Android operating systems, messaging applications or hosted on a cloud server as a standalone application, as well as maintain and provide continuous support once the chatbot is live (BotsCrew, 2021).</p><br>
    <p>We also at the outset determined to host the chatbot on a cloud server, namely AWS. The creation of a standalone application rather than an integrated chatbot into a website was considered the easier option, and given the generalised and limited information the chatbot would be trained on and interacting with, we believe there would be minimum cybersecurity concerns. Also, there were feasibility concerns in relation to hosting the chatbot on-premise given the costs involved with setting up the hardware and the need for continual support, training and updates (Engati Team, 2021) so the AWS server was found to be the most viable option. </p><br>
    <p>The creation of the chatbot itself was then begun. Using Atom, the files for the chatbot were created as well as the intents. This data was stored in YAML format as a unified and extendable way to manage all training data including NLU data, Stories and Rules files in a Rasa database format. We decided to create the intents first to ensure that there would be enough data for the chatbot to be trained on.</p><br>
    <p>Once the appropriate intents were created, the coding for the back end of the chatbot was started. In the backend, Rasa NLU and Core was used to train the chatbot on the intents that were given to it. The creation of the user interface (front end) of the chatbot was then begun. Through Atom, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages, a basic user interface design was made.</p><br>
    <p>Once the chatbot files and coding were created to produce and train the chatbot model, it was decided that, for the purpose of efficiency and hardware safety, to install a Virtual Machine. We decided to use the Oracle VM as it was sufficient for our purposes in terms of creating a chatbot. Once the VM was installed, we used Devian Linux/Ubuntu which allowed us to train the chatbot using the terminal command by applying a variety of commands, entering PIP install and Rasa, to have a full control of the chatbot from the terminal. Once Rasa is installed and while the chatbot is being trained, we are able to debug the chatbot and create a temporary web interface model from a local computer to interact with and test the product. </p><br>
    <p>The final step once the chatbot was completed was to attempt to host the chatbot on a server so that a standalone application would be able to be utilised by individuals. 

With the time constraints, we tried to upload our chatbot in AWS using EC2 instance to then be able to control its functions using PUTTY terminal on our local computer. However, we were unable to upload the chatbot with all its necessary files to the server, and so instead we have provided instead a short demonstration of the basic information that a user can request and the functions it can perform. In the future, given further time and with further experimentation, we hope to be able to attach the chatbot to a cloud-based server such as AWS so the chatbot will be live for a wider audience to interact with. </p>
