    <h2>Cristopher Ariel Castro Inostroza – S3923904</h2>
    <p>Hi, with the completion of a diploma in business management and the constant development of technology, curiosity has been triggered in me non-stop, and I’m currently learning Python (programming language) to seek an IT-related career. Born and bred in Chile, speaking two languages, Spanish (mother language) and English is second. Always the curiosity as to how things work has nested deep inside, looking at the stars wondering if one day we will have the technology to discover and see what it is beyond the naked eye. Thanks to great minds, we have achieved a portion of what humanity is capable of. As time goes by, new creations and narratives are added to our daily lives. IT enriches our life just by the fact that, by learning and apply with passion, knowledge, that could suggest and influence people and create something that will benefit the world we live in.</p>
    <h2>Steven Pigatto – S3851506</h2><br>

    <p>My name is Steven Pigatto. I am 34 years old, and I am from an Italian descent. I have a young family with 2 little kids under 5. I am currently working in the automotive industry for over 13 years. I have completed my Apprenticeship and now I run a parts warehouse distribution centre for our local dealership. My hobbies contain sport, GYM, and I’m a huge fan of Marvel Universe. I have travelled overseas to multiple countries which I mostly enjoyed. Hawaii is such a magical place to visit. I am a member of my local CFA brigade coming up to 4 years. I have been to many different fires from small to large. My current ranking is 4th Lieutenant. My IT experience is only minimal which is enough for me to get around. I am really interested in cybersecurity because it is a big issue in today's world, and I would like to learn more about it so it could lead to a dream job one day.</p>
    <h2>Nicole Attard – S3924819</h2><br>
    <hr class="line"><br>
    <p>My name is Nicole, I’m 29 and I’m from Sydney. I hold a Bachelor of Science with a major in pharmacology but went straight into a transcript typist role after I graduated. In my downtime, I love reading, catching up on TV shows and movies and playing games. When I get the chance, I also enjoy going for bike rides. I've always had an interest in IT but with everyday life moving online more and more, I have started to wonder how it all works and what new things are happening in the IT industry. While I don't have much IT experience, I am looking to change that by eventually completing a Bachelor of IT through RMIT.</p>
    <h2>Michael Sy – S3921688</h2><br>
    <hr class="line"><br>
    <p>My name is Michael Sy, a graduate of Financial Management. 10 years ago, my family and I came here to Australia from the Philippines. I have been in the retail industry for more than 20 years working from various retail stores. From managing my own home video rentals to home improvement and now working in the telecom industry. We have decided to migrate here in Australia because we like the simple way of living here. My wife works as a chef and we have a teenage son who is studying high school, doing karate lessons, and playing rep basketball. We, as a family are basketball fanatics, we follow the Golden State Warriors team in NBA.I love gadgets, particularly mobile devices, that is why I am in this kind of job right now. My interest in IT helped me to decide to go back to schooling after a decade. Though I do not carry any IT skills for the time being, I hope that I can learn, adopt, and update my skills to the current technology requirements and use it in the future to be qualified to my dream job in IT industry. </p>
    <h2>Theodore Haluska – S3925389</h2><br>
    <hr class="line"><br>
    <p>My name is Theodore I am 34 years old. I am a dual citizen (Australian/American) I spent most of my earlier years growing up in the USA before moving to Australia permanently. I enjoy playing video games, fishing, hydroponic designs and applications, programming / AI intrigue me and would be keen to learn. I have a lovely wife and son who I enjoy spending time with when I can. Overall, I am incredibly detailed when it comes to my objectives, imagining multiple scenarios or even my long-winded explanations.My interest in IT currently is around programming, even though I have minimal exposure I have a goal that I have set for myself and the only thing that may sway my decision may possibly be cyber security. My interest started when I was very young, I tore everything apart looking to see how it works and most of the time I managed to put it back together without any issues. I do not believe there was any event or person that sparked my interest, only that I have always been curious of science and technology. </p>
