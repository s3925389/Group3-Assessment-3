    <h2>Sharif Ayazi - S3815095</h2>
    <p>Completed the assessment two given me more experience and knowledge and most information. To work in a team on a project has a great moment we getting knowledge from each other’s and getting more experience. We started our third assignment and project with the chatbot. The chatbot is a project that I didn’t know much about it. We have done many processes in this project. From designing to coding and creating prestation till testing and handing for user. During this assignment I learned many things the way of communication as team member, coding, process of a project from start to end and so on. 
The chatbot idea suggested by Cris. He explained in the meeting that what is the chatbot and how does it work, and what advantage the chatbot has for the user. After getting a brief information about the chat bot all team members accepted to go ahead with the chatbot. we started the chatbot project Cris has done the development section. Every week we had meeting and we discussed about process of the project. We made a the document and presentation for the chatbot.

        <p>Teamwork is an enjoyable experience, gives us insights of how working in a professional environment is going to look like. This chatbot was created applying different kind of technologies and tools nevertheless the challenge was obvious since we have never created one, we had start from the very scratch looking for the best option brainstorming a lot, researching in google and the website RASA which set the foundation of Templar Chatbot. The entire project was a constant trial and error, many files were created and deleted in the process many times we had to install and uninstalled different software and libraries. Again, more research, a lot of reading and connecting with the community which in general is insanely helpful.</p><br>
        <p>This was a wonderful experience that gives us knowledge and wisdom that we could bring forward a real project that in time could be profitable.</p><br>

    <h2>Steven Pigatto – S3851506 </h2>
        <p>Coming into the assessment not knowing much about chatbots, except for knowing they are used on websites and can be annoying at times, it was going to be challenging for me to understand the concept of development of the chatbot and tools used to create it. Over the past weeks researching the areas that I was assigned to in the project, it was challenging but interesting at the same time.  I covered the landscape of chat bots and the risks which seeing all different types and what they are used for different functions as mind blowing. Like I said, I didn’t know much about them and different functions they can perform. Not understanding the risks on developing the chatbot was another issue I had. But understanding how the project is made it gave me a wider understanding of what risks you can come across. It’s not a simple little chatbot on your screen after all, there is hundreds of hours been put into making one and getting it to achieve the goal you set out for.</p><br>
        <p>I believe completing the project and listen to my team members have me more knowledge around the chatbot platform then I started. The evolution is evolving with advancements of chatbots that can help you complete your work or answer questions just like a normal human. I felt like I couldn’t do as much as I could in the last assessment because of no knowledge of the chatbots but I would put my hand up and gave it ago. I sort of sat back in my comfort zone but talking to my members in the chat about issues helped me gain confidence. </p><br>

        <p>Working with this group of people has truly been such an enjoyable experience. Juggling personal and family commitments, to be able to maintain focus and make great efforts to ensure effective communication in order to create a product has been a great achievement. Initially starting out having basic, limited knowledge in the process involved in developing a chatbot, my time working with this team on this project has been a valuable experience in not only the practical aspect, but also the planning and documentary aspects.   </p><br>
	<p>One area where we could have improved for this project would have been at the start. I feel we could have more clearly set out the roles for everyone especially in the development process. However, this would have been particularly difficult given the limited knowledge we as a group had in relation to creating a chatbot but also the fact that given the scope of the project, the issues that we had in relation to working in real time collaboratively on a shared file where members would accidentally overwrite the work of others would have possibly arisen and complicated the process. </p><br>
	<p>Overall, I feel we were able to meet our main objectives, having discussed and analysed feedback given following our first project together as a team. We effectively limited the scope and achieved basically what we hoped to: a chatbot that responds appropriately to text-based inputs from a user. However, despite our best attempts, we were unable to host our chatbot on a server which would have enabled users without the project files to interact with the chatbot. Given the skills and ability of the entire team that has been demonstrated throughout this time, I believe that with more time, this is an achievable outcome. </p><br>

    <h2>Michael Sy – S3921688  </h2>
        <p>When we had our first meeting regarding assignment 3, we did some brainstorming on what IT project we can come up to that will enable us all to work as a team with the given timeframe. Then came the idea of a working chatbot. The idea is so big and ambitious knowing there are lots of chatbots already in the market that vary from different categories and usage. As a group, we went back to the drawing board and tried to discuss what specific chatbot we wanted to create and who would be our market for this. There are some suggestions that float from our team members like a chatbot that will be focusing on our school helping students accessing assignments guide and instructions. The idea of merging another team member’s IT project into a chatbot was also considered.</p><br>
        <p>After some deliberation and discussions, we now have a clear vision of what our chatbot will be like. We started working on it as well as assignment 5 which is the video presentation. Just like in Assignment 2, we encountered some problems. Since the lockdown has been lifted, we have all become so busy with our work and other responsibilities, making it a bit of a challenge to spend time on our project. However, the thing that I love about our group is the respect, understanding and camaraderie that we are all showing to each other. No one thought that we could pull out this project, but with proven dedications and hardworks as well as the skills rendered by talented team members, we were able to finish the project and produce a working chatbot. </p><br>
        <hr class="line"><br>
    
    <h2>Theodore Haluska - S3925389 </h2>
    <p>Our first group project was what I believed to be an overall success. We had put in a lot of effort and time to sticking to a project idea that we had viewed as being viable considering our group is quite spread out and unable to collaborate in a physical setting. Although our feedback from the first assignment had been a bit discouraging, we continued to push ahead with our original project idea, I mean we did name ourselves the Conquerors so there was no turning back, we pushed forward to accomplish what we had set out to do.</p><br>
    <p>Cris worked hard and accomplished a basic chatbot using Keywords / Script Based. I believe this is not only a personal accomplishment for Cris but for the team as well, during this time I had the unfortunate change of job in order to look after myself but as well as my family being the sole provider for our household my new position has taken a larger portion of my time and I had not been able to contribute as much as I would have liked to the second portion of the assignment, thankfully I am part of a wonderful group who understood the personal commitments that take relevance and they had put in the extra effort to complete the assignment where I was unable.</p><br>
    <p>The surprising thing is how well we all worked together in the end to accomplish our goal. Another thing I have learned, group work is dependent on you and your team mates, they are more than willing to go the extra mile if someone is in a tough circumstance. </p><br>

    <h2>Group Reflection </h2><br>
        <p>After receiving our results for the first group assessment, the team reflected on the results and the feedback. Our meetings on the this was productive, and we all wanted to improve in the next assessment. But overall, we believe our work we completed was a success, but we had room to improve in different areas. All up, it was a great effort.
    </p><br>
    <p>The team have been meeting twice a week to discuss the process and progress of the next two group assessments. As a group, we all decided to proceed with the Chatbot as our project idea. The idea of the Chatbot we chose was Cris’s idea and as a group we all agreed with the idea. The group found this as a challenge in all ways. Majority of the team members didn’t know much about the processes of creating the Chatbot or the background, so this would be a learning curve for us.</p><br>
    <p>Once our idea was in place, our focus turned to the first submission of a draft for the presentation. The team discussed what we should put in and the script for it. The layout was completed, and the focus was quickly shifted to the main Assessment. </p><br>
    <p>Laying out the sections on a word document and discussing the areas what we should do, the group agreed on which sections and timeframe we should have completed and be put in the draft. Identifying the main section of the project were the marks lay, the group came up with a theme for the Chatbot. The Knights Templar was born! He was our face for the project idea. He will be a funny but serious Knight that would help the user around websites that it was assigned for. The members of our team agreed on to choose a couple of sections to work on for the project. </p><br>
    <p>Going back to the presentation, our work would be displayed on a PowerPoint format with music and voice overs. The work of our members to put it altogether was outstanding. The creativity of the members was fascinating, and we all thank each other for the effort everyone put in. </p><br>
    <p>In the last week before the project was due, our meetings became important to see where the project was at and what areas required to be completed. The Chatbot was running and talking back, which was a good thing. We had the final product ready. Going over the completed assessment, one last meeting was performed. The team looked over the website to check any mistakes or issues. Once we all agreed everything looked fine, Submitting was the next step. </p><br>
    <p>The past 2 months working as a group, strangers coming together for one common goal showed us how teams work in the real world of IT. We all became good friends throughout our studies and hoping we can keep in touch in the real world. We all wish each other the best success in our career paths in the future. </p>
