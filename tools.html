    <h2>Tools<br><br><strong>Microsoft Teams</strong></h2><br>
    <p>
        As with the previous assignment, for this project, we have continued using Microsoft Teams as our main communication platform. As we have become more accustomed to the features of Teams that may be utilised for planning and scheduling purposes, we have found that the easy and immediate sharing of information is a major benefit to working on collaborative projects such as this one.
    </p><br>
    <p>The feature of Teams that has been utilised the most throughout this project has been the integrated Microsoft Word application. This feature allows team members to collaboratively work on one document and showing changes made in real-time. This means that, especially for a project such as this where one member is not necessarily working on one defined section, we were able to work effectively to complete all requirements without excessive overlapping. It also allowed us to provide immediate feedback and make changes to the work of others. Microsoft Word through Teams also provides a version history, where team members are able to see what changes were made when and by who if clarification or updates are required. </p><br>
    <p>After analysis of the previous assessment, we attempted to more effectively use the Microsoft Tasks by Planner feature for setting up completion dates and task deadlines to keep on track of the project. However, given that this assessment involved greater collaboration between all members for all the different sections, the firmer deadlines that were agreed upon during the meetings and recorded in the minutes provided enough structure that the fact that there was limited use of the Tasks feature did not have too much of an impact upon the ability to work together as a team.</p><br>
    <h2>GitHub </h2>
    <p>Similar to the previous assessment, in order to create a group website, GitHub was used. GitHub is an online open-source tool that allows users to work together on a single project through real-time collaboration and editing of files such as html, CSS or coding files and uploading and sharing files. After receiving feedback in relation to our previous website which can be found here, in order to start afresh in order to modify and upgrade the style of the site, we have created an entirely new GitHub page that focuses on the current project plan. </p><br>
    <p>During our previous collaboration on GitHub, though eventually successful, a major issue arose in terms of multiple team members pushing commits from local machines to the main repository file before pulling and merging changes made by other members that had been made in the meantime, effectively leading to those changes being overwritten. </p><br>
    <p>Given this particular difficulty, for this project, we initially considered a more structured use of GitHub involving greater communication in terms of when users were making changes to the index file to ensure that only one user was working at any particular time on the shared file so that no data would be overwritten. However, given the time limit for this assessment and the fact that each individual team member has other commitments such as work and family that affect scheduling, it was agreed that one team member would be responsible for solely inputting the data contained in the shared Word document and making the commits on GitHub, while the others would focus on preparing the necessary content and information required for the report.</p><br>
    <p>The result of this approach, however, is that for the repository used for this website, the GitHub audit trail reflects only a few team members committing and making changes to the website, with one main contributor to both the HTML and CSS files. Despite this, the previous GitHub repository used for the Conquerorâ€™s first group assessment was able to effectively demonstrate how an audit trail appears when a group works collaboratively. A quick review of the index HTML file in the previous repository shows several commits that were effectively re-adding or amending various sections that were mistakenly overwritten. </p><br>
    <p>As a result of our approach this time, to get an accurate reflection of the contributions of each team member, it is appropriate to consider the audit trails of both GitHub and the version history in the integrated Word application on Teams, as well as the meeting minutes and agendas to get a broad overview of the responsibilities, roles and contributions undertaken by each team member. </p>
